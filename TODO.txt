whole nightmare with if settings are all set up
urgent check all settings there
check that xmls are right, as in all there
selinux stuff still isn't all ok. i don't know the best way to deal with selinux
remove stuff about starting services manually and just start the webapp and give appropiate message, and even open if we can
should really automate ftp script for my own sanity
sql security?
timezone stuff in settings 
data validation all
xml->db doesn't catch up old dates when systemd startup
